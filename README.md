This code through explores the relationship between sports betting consumption. household consumption trends, and economic sentiment, aiming to determine whether consumers treat spending on betting platforms similarly to essential household expenditures and adjust their spending to match their current outlook of the economy’s performance. By analyzing available financial and behavioral data, this project investigates the potential economic and psychological connections between traditional consumption and the rising normalization of sports betting.



Content Overview
Specifically, we’ll explain and demonstrate how spending patterns on popular sports betting platforms like FanDuel, BetMGM, ESPNBet and PrizePicks compare to household personal consumption expenditures. We’ll also incorporate consumer sentiment data to explore whether changes in economic optimism correlate with betting behavior. We will be using public data sources such as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) database, as well as public data collected by the Colorado Department of Revenue reporting betting proceeds each month in the state of Colorado, all of which has been manually compiled into one convenient dataset called “coloradosb.” A visualization will help map and interpret these relationships over time.
